Wimbi: A Spatial Gesture Based Search Tool

Wimbi is a prototype for gesture based dimesnion filtering. It is a Unity application that will translate hand distance and gestures into a 3 dimensional bounding box. Search results are then provided for sample objects that can fit within that constraint.

Requirements:
Leap Motion Sensor
Windows 10 PC with microphone
Unity 2017.3 (recommended, but might work with other versions)

To Run:
Download and import to Unity. Open the scene labeled TestScene.
Play!

How to Use:
Say one of the following to select an object or use the keyboard button alternative 
+ Candle ['c']
+ Artwork ['a']
+ Flower Vase ['f']

move your hands to create size and shape
Pinching will lock the dimensions that you have modified so far. Distance between hands is used to estimate sizes

say "Search" or press S to search for objects that fit within that size.

Say "Reset" to repeat or press 'r'.
